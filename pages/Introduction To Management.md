					- Divide work and responsibility almost equally between management and workers. Management does all work for which it is better suited than the workers.
			- `General Administrative`: An approach to management that focuses on describing what managers do and what constitutes good management practice
			  collapsed:: true
				- Fayol’s 14 Principles of Management
				  collapsed:: true
					- `Division of work`. Specialization increases output by making employees more efficient.
					- `Authority`. Managers must be able to give orders, and authority gives them this right.
					- `Discipline`. Employees must obey and respect the rules that govern the organization.
					- `Unity of command`. Every employee should receive orders from only one superior.
					- `Unity of direction`. The organization should have a single plan of action to guide managers and workers.
					- `Subordination of individual interests to the general interest`. The interests of any one employee or group of employees should not take precedence over the interests of the organization as a whole.
					- `Remuneration`. Workers must be paid a fair wage for their services.
					- `Centralization`. This term refers to the degree to which subordinates are involved in decision making.
					- `Scalar chain`. The line of authority from top management to the lowest ranks is the scalar chain.
					- `Order`. People and materials should be in the right place at the right time.
					- `Equity`. Managers should be kind and fair to their subordinates.
					- `Stability of tenure of personnel`. Management should provide orderly personnel planning and ensure that replacements are available to fill vacancies.
					- `Initiative`. Employees allowed to originate and carry out plans will exert high levels of effort.
					- `Esprit de corps`. Promoting team spirit will build harmony and unity within the organization.
				- `bureaucracy` - A form of organization characterized by division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, detailed rules and regulations, and impersonal relationships

			  collapsed:: true
				- `Intense focus on the customer` . The customer includes outsiders who buy the organization’s products or services and internal customers who interact with and serve others in the organization.
				- `Concern for continual improvement`. Quality management is a commitment to never being satisfied. “Very good” is not good enough. Quality can always be improved.
				- `Process focused`. Quality management focuses on work processes as the quality of goods and services is continually improved.
				- `Improvement in the quality of everything the organization does`. This relates to the final product, how the organization handles deliveries, how rapidly it responds to complaints, how politely the phones are answered, and the like.
				- `Accurate measurement`. Quality management uses statistical techniques to measure every critical variable in the organization’s operations. These are compared against standards to identify problems, trace them to their roots, and eliminate their causes.
				- `Empowerment of employees`. Quality management involves the people on the line in the improvement process. Teams are widely used in quality management programs as empowerment vehicles for finding and solving problems.

					- `Organization Size`. As size increases, so do the problems of coordination. For instance, the type of organization structure appropriate for an organization of 50,000 employees is likely to be inefficient for an organization of 50 employees.
					- `Routineness of Task Technology`. To achieve its purpose, an organization uses technology. Routine technologies require organizational structures, leadership styles, and control systems that differ from those required by customized or nonroutine technologies.
					- `Environmental Uncertainty`. The degree of uncertainty caused by environmental changes influences the management process. What works best in a stable and predictable environment may be totally inappropriate in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment.
					- `Individual Differences`. Individuals differ in terms of their desire for growth, autonomy, tolerance of ambiguity, and expectations. These and other individual differences are particularly important when managers select motivation techniques, leadership styles, and job designs.

	- Developing Your Coaching Skills
		- Know the goal
		  collapsed:: true
			- One of the characteristics of an effective team, as you’ll see in this chapter, is having clear goals. Teams that are able to achieve high levels of performance have a clear understanding of the goals to be achieved. Team members will be committed to the team’s goals, know what they’re expected to accomplish, and understand how they need to work together to achieve these goals.
		- Know your team
		  collapsed:: true
			- Just as important as having clear goals and knowing the goals is knowing the skills, abilities, and motivations of each team member. An effective coach knows what each team member brings to the team and where each person might contribute most effectively.
		- Build a relationship of mutual trust
		  collapsed:: true
			- The foundation of an excellent team-coach relationship is mutual trust. Again, you’ll see this discussed in the chapter as one of the characteristics of an effective team. Without mutual trust, a coach won’t be able to be honest in guiding the team and in giving feedback and team members won’t be open to receiving the feedback and being guided.
		- Provide feedback
		  collapsed:: true
			- Effective coaches recognize and understand the value and importance of giving continual performance feedback—both positive and corrective—to their team. Anyone who has played a sport knows that a good coach constantly gives feedback so that you can get better at it. If you want your team to be effective, team members need to know where they stand and where they need to “step up their game.” (See Chapter 18’s It’s Your Career for advice on how to be effective at giving feedback.)
		- Create an atmosphere of accountability.
		  collapsed:: true
			- In a team environment where work is done collectively, it’s important that team members and the coach are accountable to each other and to the team. What does it mean to be accountable? Be responsible. Follow through on commitments to each other. Don’t make excuses. Don’t whine. Don’t point fingers at each other. That’s what it  means to be accountable. And it’s important!
	- Examples of Formal Work Groups
		- `Command groups` — Groups determined by the organizational chart and composed of individuals who report directly to a given manager.
		- `Task groups` — Groups composed of individuals brought together to complete a specific job task; their existence is often temporary because when the task is completed, the group disbands.
		- `Cross-functional teams` — Groups that bring together the knowledge and skills of individuals from various work areas or groups whose members have been trained to do each others’ jobs.
		- `Self-managed teams` — Groups that are essentially independent and that, in addition to their own tasks, take on traditional managerial responsibilities such as hiring, planning and scheduling, and evaluating performance.

		- virtual team
		  collapsed:: true
			- A type of work team that uses technology to link physically dispersed members in order to achieve a common goal
	- Creating Effective Work Teams
		- CLEAR GOALS
		  collapsed:: true
			- High-performance teams have a clear understanding of the goal to be achieved. Members are committed to the team’s goals, know what they’re expected to accomplish, and understand how they will work together to achieve these goals.
		- RELEVANT SKILLS
		  collapsed:: true
			- Effective teams are composed of competent individuals who have the necessary technical and interpersonal skills to achieve the desired goals while working well together. This last point is important because not everyone who is technically competent has the interpersonal skills to work well as a team member.
		- MUTUAL TRUST
		  collapsed:: true
			- Effective teams are characterized by high mutual trust among members. That is, members believe in each other’s ability, character, and integrity. But as you probably know from personal relationships, trust is fragile. Maintaining this trust requires careful attention by managers.
		- UNIFIED COMMITMENT
		  collapsed:: true
			- Unified commitment is characterized by dedication to the team’s goals and a willingness to expend extraordinary amounts of energy to achieve them. Members of an effective team exhibit intense loyalty and dedication to the team and are willing to do whatever it takes to help their team succeed.
		- GOOD COMMUNICATION
		  collapsed:: true
			- Not surprisingly, effective teams are characterized by good communication. Members convey messages, verbally and nonverbally, between each other in ways that are readily and clearly understood. Also, feedback helps guide team members and correct misunderstandings. Like a couple who has been together for many years, members of high-performing teams are able to quickly and efficiently share ideas and feelings.
		- NEGOTIATING SKILLS
		  collapsed:: true
			- Effective teams are continually making adjustments to who does what. This flexibility requires team members to possess negotiating skills. Because problems and relationships regularly change within teams, members need to be able to confront and reconcile differences.
		- APPROPRIATE LEADERSHIP
		  collapsed:: true
			- Effective leaders are important. They can motivate a team to follow them through the most difficult situations. How? By clarifying goals, demonstrating that change is possible by overcoming inertia, increasing the self confidence of team members, and helping members to more fully realize their potential. Increasingly, effective team leaders act as coaches and facilitators. They help guide and support the team, but don’t control it. Studies have shown that when a team leader’s emotional displays—positive and negative—are used at appropriate times, the team’s functioning and performance can be enhanced
		- INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT
		  collapsed:: true
			- The final condition necessary for an effective team is a supportive climate. Internally, the team should have a sound infrastructure, which means proper training, a clear and reasonable measurement system that team members can use to evaluate their overall performance, an incentive program that recognizes and rewards team activities, and a supportive human resource system. The right infrastructure should support members and reinforce behaviors that lead to high levels of performance. Externally, managers should provide the team with the resources needed to get the job done.
	- Managing Global Teams
		- Two characteristics of today’s organizations are obvious: They’re global, and work
		  is increasingly done by teams. These two aspects mean that any manager is likely to
		  have to manage a global team.
		- GROUP MEMBER RESOURCES IN GLOBAL TEAMS
		  collapsed:: true
			- In global organizations, understanding the relationship between group performance and group member resources is more challenging because of the unique cultural characteristics represented by members of a global team. In addition to recognizing team members’ abilities, skills, knowledge, and personality, managers need to be familiar with and clearly understand the cultural characteristics of the groups and the group members they manage.
		- GROUP STRUCTURE
		  collapsed:: true
			- Some of the structural areas where we see differences in managing global teams include conformity, status, social loafing, and cohesiveness.
		- GROUP PROCESSES
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processes global teams use to do their work can be particularly challenging for managers. For one thing, communication issues often arise because not all team members may be fluent in the team’s working language. This can lead to inaccuracies, misunderstandings, and inefficiencies.
			- However, research also has shown that a multicultural global team is better able to capitalize on the diversity of ideas represented if a wide range of information is used.
		- MANAGER’S ROLE
		  collapsed:: true
			- Despite the challenges associated with managing global teams, managers can provide the group with an environment in which efficiency and effectiveness are enhanced
			- First, because communication skills are vital, managers should focus on developing those skills. Also, as we’ve said earlier, managers must consider cultural differences when deciding what type of global team to use
			- Finally, it’s vital that managers be sensitive to the unique differences of each member of the global team, but it’s also important that team members be sensitive to each other
	- Building Team Skills
		- With the emphasis on teams in today’s organizations, managers need to recognize that people don’t automatically know how to be part of a team or to be an effective team member. Like any behavior, sometimes you have to learn about the skill and then keep practicing and reinforcing it. In building team skills, managers must view their role as more of being a coach and developing team members in order to create more committed, collaborative, and inclusive teams.
	- Understanding Social Networks
		- `social network structure` - The patterns of informal connections among individuals within a group
		- Managers need to understand the social networks and social relationships of work groups. Why? Because a group’s informal social relationships can help or hinder its effectiveness.
- # Chapter 13 - Human Resource Management
  collapsed:: true
	- **how to negotiate pay.**
		- Do you want the job?
			- This is perhaps the most important question you must answer. Set pay considerations aside and weigh the pros and cons of the job. The following questions are the ones you should think about: Will this job help me embark on a rewarding career path? Do I fit well with the culture? Am I happy with the location? If you do want the job, then it’s time to think about your salary offer.
		- Research what similar companies pay new hires.
			- It’s important to consider a variety of sources to ensure that you understand the pay norm for your job offer. Start with your school’s career services counselors. They have worked with many students in your situation and the companies that hire them. Also, check out online resources that provide information about pay. There are many you can choose from. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the Occupational Outlook Handbook, which lists pay information for a variety of jobs and occupations. Consider websites such as Glassdoor (www.glassdoor.com), where you may find employee self-reports of pay for similar jobs, and, perhaps even for your prospective employer. There are many others, including jobstar.org, salary.com, and payscale.com.
		- Make sense of the data.
			- Look at whether companies in different industries pay similarly. For example, companies in manufacturing industries generally pay more than companies in service industries.
			- Also, watch for whether pay differs based on location. It will cost you a lot more to rent an apartment in San Francisco than in Fargo, North Dakota.
		- Prepare for the pay discussion.
			- Think about your reservation pay rate; that is, the lowest amount you are willing to accept. Come up with a range of pay rather than a single amount. It is important to show flexibility and signal that you are willing to be a team player. Prepare the rationale for making your request.
			- Always make reference to the data. Companies will give consideration to objective data.
			- Never base your request on statements such as “I’m worth it.” Job  offers are based on future potential. Remember that you have yet to prove yourself.
		- Have the discussion.
			- Thank the organization’s representative for making the job offer and express your excitement about the opportunity.
			- Briefly summarize how you will become a productive member of the team. Before discussing pay, ask your other questions.
			- Then, make your case for higher pay. Listen carefully to the representative’s response. For example, you may hear that every new hire makes the same rate. Or the organization’s policy is to start new hires with lower pay and award bonuses based on performance.
			- Possible responses include denying your request, accepting your request, or offering a lower additional amount than requested. In any event, be sure to thank the company representative for their consideration.
		- Communicate your decision.
			- If you plan to accept the offer, tell the representative that you will do so promptly after receiving written confirmation.
			- If you choose not to accept the offer, express your appreciation for the organization’s consideration and follow up with an e-mail or letter. Remember, they have taken time to consider you. And you may want to work for that company in the future.

	- `operations management` - The transformation process that converts resources into finished goods and services
	- Operations management is important to organizations and managers for three reasons:
		- it encompasses both services and manufacturing
		- it’s important in effectively and efficiently managing productivity
		- it plays a strategic role in an organization’s competitive success
	- Roles of Operations Management
		- Services and Manufacturing
		  collapsed:: true
			- `manufacturing organizations` - Organizations that produce physical goods
			- `service organizations` - Organizations that produce nonphysical products in the form of services
		- Managing Productivity

		- Strategic Role of Operations Management
		  collapsed:: true
			- To develop modern, computer-based, and technologically advanced facilities that fully integrated manufacturing operations into strategic planning decisions.
	- `value` - The performance characteristics, features, and attributes, and any other aspects of goods and services for which customers are willing to give up resources
	- `value chain` - The entire series of organizational work activities that add value at each step from raw materials to finished product
	- Value Chain Management
		- `value chain management` - The process of managing the sequence of activities and information along the entire value chain
		- Every organization needs customers if it’s going to survive and prosper. Even a not-for-profit organization must have “customers” who use its services or purchase its products. Customers want some type of value from the goods and services they purchase or use, and these customers decide what has value. Organizations must provide that value to attract and keep customers.
	- Goal of Value Chain Management
	  collapsed:: true
		- In value chain management, ultimately customers are the ones with power. They’re the ones who define what value is and how it’s created and provided. Using value chain management, managers hope to find that unique combination that offers customers solutions to truly meet their unique needs incredibly fast and at a price that can’t be matched by competitors.
		- the goal of value chain management is to create a value chain strategy that meets and exceeds customers’ needs and desires and allows for full and seamless integration among all members of the chain. A good value chain involves a sequence of participants working together as a team, each adding some component of value—such as faster assembly, more accurate information, better customer response and service, and so forth—to the overall process.
	- Benefits of Value Chain Management
	  collapsed:: true
		- Collaborating with external and internal partners in creating and managing a successful value chain strategy requires significant investments in time, energy, and other resources, and a serious commitment by all chain partners. Given these demands, why would managers ever choose to implement value chain management? A survey of manufacturers noted four primary benefits of value chain management: improved procurement, improved logistics, improved product development, and enhanced customer order management.

			- COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION
			  collapsed:: true
				- For the value chain to achieve its goal of meeting and exceeding customers’ needs and desires, collaborative relationships among all chain participants must exist.26 Each partner must identify things he or she may not value but that customers do. Sharing information and being flexible as far as who in the value chain does what are important steps in building coordination and collaboration. This sharing of information and analysis requires more open communication among the various value chain partners.
			- TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT
			  collapsed:: true
				- Successful value chain management isn’t possible without a significant investment in information technology. The payoff from this investment, however, is that information technology can be used to restructure the value chain to better serve end users.
			- ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESSES
			  collapsed:: true
				- The ways that organizational work is done
			- LEADERSHIP
			  collapsed:: true
				- Successful value chain management isn’t possible without strong and committed leadership. From top organizational levels to lower levels, managers must support, facilitate, and promote the implementation and ongoing practice of value chain management. Managers must seriously commit to identifying what value is, how that value can best be provided, and how successful those efforts have been.
			- EMPLOYEES/HUMAN RESOURCES
			  collapsed:: true
				- We know from our discussions of management theories throughout this text that employees are an organization’s most important resource. Without employees, no products are produced and no services are delivered—in fact, no organized efforts in the pursuit of common goals would be possible. So not surprisingly, employees play an important role in value chain management. The three main human resource requirements for value chain management are flexible approaches to job design, an effective hiring process, and ongoing training.
			- ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND ATTITUDES
			  collapsed:: true
				- The last requirement for value chain management is having a supportive organizational culture and attitudes. From our extensive description of value chain management, you could probably guess the type of organizational culture that’s going to support its successful implementation! Those cultural attitudes include sharing, collaborating, openness, flexibility, mutual respect, and trust. These attitudes encompass not only the internal partners in the value chain, but extend to external partners as well.
		- Obstacles to Value Chain Management
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1656932403522_0.png)
			- ORGANIZATIONAL BARRIERS
			  collapsed:: true
				- Organizational barriers are among the most difficult obstacles to handle. These barriers include refusal or reluctance to share information, reluctance to shake up the status quo, and security issues. Without shared information, close coordination and collaboration is impossible. And the reluctance or refusal of employees to shake up the status quo can impede efforts toward value chain management and prevent its successful implementation
			- CULTURAL ATTITUDES
			  collapsed:: true
				- Unsupportive cultural attitudes—especially trust and control—also can be obstacles to value chain management. The trust issue is a critical one, both lack of trust and too much trust. To be effective, partners in a value chain must trust each other. A mutual respect for, and honesty about, each partner’s activities all along the chain is essential. When that trust doesn’t exist, the partners will be reluctant to share information, capabilities, and processes. But too much trust also can be a problem. Just about any organization is vulnerable to theft of intellectual property
			- REQUIRED CAPABILITIES
			  collapsed:: true
				- We know from our earlier discussion of requirements for the successful implementation of value chain management that value chain partners need numerous capabilities. Several of these capabilities—coordination and collaboration, the ability to configure products to satisfy customers and suppliers, and the ability to educate internal and external partners—aren’t easy, but they’re essential to capturing and exploiting the value chain
			- PEOPLE
			  collapsed:: true
				- The final obstacles to successful value chain management can be an organization’s people. Without their unwavering commitment to do whatever it takes, value chain management won’t be successful. If employees refuse to be flexible in their work—how and with whom they work—collaboration and cooperation throughout the value chain will be hard to achieve.
	- CURRENT issues in managing operations
		- Technology’s Role in Operations Management
		  collapsed:: true
			- Global positioning systems (GPS) are changing a number of enterprises from shipping to shopping, from health care to law enforcement, and even farming.39 Like many other technologies, GPS was invented for military use to track weapons and personnel as they moved. Now GPS is being used to track shipping fleets, revitalize consumer products such as watches or photos, and monitor parolees or sex offenders.
			- Technology used by two national chains tells managers how much food they need to prepare by counting vehicles in the drive through line and factoring in demand for current promotional and popular staple items. Even Domino’s is using a new point-of-sale system to attract customers and streamline online orders.40
			- Technology is also allowing organizations to control costs, particularly in the areas of predictive maintenance, remote diagnostics, and utility cost savings.

			  collapsed:: true
				- Managers must have quality improvement goals and strategies and plans to achieve those goals.
			- ORGANIZING AND LEADING FOR QUALITY
			  collapsed:: true
				- Because quality improvement initiatives are carried out by organizational employees, it’s important for managers to look at how they can best organize and lead them
				- Organizations with extensive and successful quality improvement programs tend to rely on two important people approaches: cross-functional work teams and self directed or empowered work teams. Because achieving product quality is something that all employees from upper to lower levels must participate in, it’s not surprising that quality-driven organizations rely on well-trained, flexible, and empowered employees.
			- CONTROLLING FOR QUALITY
			  collapsed:: true
				- Quality improvement initiatives aren’t possible without having some way to monitor and evaluate their progress. Whether it involves standards for inventory control, defect rate, raw materials procurement, or other operations management areas, controlling for quality is important.
		- Quality Goals
			- To publicly demonstrate their quality commitment, many organizations worldwide have pursued challenging quality goals—the two best-known being ISO 9000 and Six Sigma.
			- ISO 9000
			  collapsed:: true
				- A series of international quality management standards that set uniform guidelines for processes to ensure products conform to customer requirements
				  id:: 62c2c0fd-7d30-4f20-8f5b-088db07e4f38
				- established by the International Organization for Standardization (www.iso.org), which set uniform guidelines for processes to ensure that products conform to customer requirements.
			- SIX SIGMA
			  collapsed:: true
				- A quality program designed to reduce defects and help lower costs, save time, and improve customer satisfaction
				- It’s based on the statistical standard that establishes a goal of no more than 3.4 defects per million units or procedures.
		- Mass Customization and Lean Organization
			- `mass customization` - Providing customers with a product when, where, and how they want it
			- `lean organization` - An organization that understands what customers want, identifies customer value by analyzing all activities required to produce products, and then optimizes the entire process from the customer’s perspective
			- With flexible manufacturing, companies have the ability to quickly readjust assembly lines to make products to order. Using technology such as computer-controlled factory equipment, intranets, industrial robots, barcode scanners, digital printers, and logistics software, companies can manufacture, assemble, and ship customized products with customized packaging to customers in incredibly short timeframes.
			- Technology also is important in the continual dialogue with customers. Using extensive databases, companies can keep track of customers’ likes and dislikes. And the Internet has made it possible for companies to have ongoing dialogues with customers to learn about and respond to their exact preferences.
