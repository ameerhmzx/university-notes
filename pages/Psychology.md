- # Part 1 - Introduction
  collapsed:: true
	- Psychology
		- A scientific study of human behavior and mental processes
		- Etymologically, it came from the Greek words, Psyche which means `soul` or `mind`, and Logos which means `the study of`.
	- Behavior
		- Any response or activity of an organism
		- It can either be simple or complex; overt or covert; conscious or unconscious; voluntary or involuntary; rational or irrational
	- Tabula rasa by `John Locke`
		- Believed that at birth the human mind is a `tabula rasa` or a blank slate, on which experience “writes” knowledge.
	- Theory of Evolution
		- Charles Darwin
	- Father of Mental tests
		- Francis Galton
	- Father of Modern Psychology
		- Wilhelm Wundt
	- Structuralism
		- Structuralism is the approach of psychology which emphasis on the study of components of consciousness
	- Functionalism
		- Rather than focusing on the elements of consciousness, functionalists focused on the purpose of consciousness and behavior.
	- Introspection
		- is the examination of one's own conscious thoughts and feelings

- # Part 2 - Types and Scope
  collapsed:: true
	- Classical Conditioning `Ivan Pavlov`
		- The typical procedure for inducing classical conditioning involves presentations of a neutral stimulus along with a stimulus of some significance.
		- The neutral stimulus could be any event that does not result in an overt behavioral response from the organism under investigation. Pavlov referred to this as a Conditioned Stimulus (CS).
	- Operant conditioning `B F Skinner`
		- Operant conditioning can be defined as a type of learning in which voluntary (controllable; non-reflexive) behavior is strengthened if it is reinforced and weakened if it is punished (or not reinforced).
	- Psychodynamic approach `Sigmund Freud`
		- The approach based on the belief that behavior is motivated by unconscious inner forces over which the individual has little control.
		- Key features of the Psychodynamic approach are:
			- Our behavior and feelings as adults are rooted in our childhood experiences.
			  Relationships (particularly parenting) are of primary importance in determining how we feel and behave.
			- Our behavior and feelings are powerfully affected by the meaning of events to the unconscious mind.  Information can be obtained from dreams, irrational behavior and what patients in therapy say.
			- The personality is made up of three distinct structures: id, ego and super ego.
			  Defense mechanisms are used to protect the ego, e.g. repression.
			- Children develop through a series of fixed stages: oral, anal and phallic.
	- Five Stages of growth and development:
		- Oral
			- Zone: Mouth
			- Primary Interaction: Mouth
			- Age: 0 - 1 years
			- Derive pleasure from oral stimulation such as eating, tasting and sucking
			- Problems
				- Drinking
				- Smoking
				- Nail Biting
		- Anal
			- Zone: Bowel and bladder
			- Age: 1 - 3 Years
			- Primary Focus: Controlling Bowel and Bladder Movements
			- The child has to learn its body needs
			- Problems
				- if learnt can cause destructive, wasteful and messy personality.
				- strictness can cause orderly, rigid and obsessive personality.
		- Phallic
			- Age: 3 - 6 years
			- Zone: Genitals
			- Primary Focus: Genitals
			- Child became to discover differences of males and females.
			- Affection with opposite sex parents
		- Latent
			- Age: 6 to puberty
			- Zone: Sexual feelings are inactive
			- Super ego and ego continuous to develop and id is suppressed
			- development of social skills, values and relationships
			- Problems:
				- if stuck or fixated in this phase, results in immaturity and inability to form relationships
		- Genital
			- Age: puberty to death
			- Zone: Maturing Sexual Interest
			- Puberty causes libido to become active once again
			- Strong sexual interest in opposite sex
			- Goal - establish balance in different phases of life
	- Gestalt `Max Wertheimer`
		- Gestalt is a German word that means roughly means “shape”, “form”, “essence”, or “whole”.
		  Gestalt is a psychology term which means "unified whole".

		  One of the most important theories of perception is the Gestalt Theory.
		- “The Whole is different from the sum of its part”.
	- Humanistic psychology
		- Humanistic psychology emphasizes looking at the whole individual and stresses concepts such as free will, self-efficacy, and self-actualization.  Rather than concentrating on dysfunction, humanistic psychology strives to help people fulfill their potential and maximize their well-being.
	- Cognitive psychology
		- Studies mental processes including how people think, perceive, remember and learn. As part of the larger field of cognitive science, this branch of psychology is related to other disciplines including neuroscience, philosophy, and linguistics.
	- Fields of psychology

- # Part 3 - Motivation
  collapsed:: true
	- Motivation
		- Motivation is the set of reasons that determines one to engage in a particular behavior.
		- The psychological feature that arouses an organism to action toward a desired goal; the reason for the action; that which gives purpose and direction to behavior.
		- Types:
			- Intrinsic Motivation
				- An internal stimulus that arouses one to action. It is based on  motive, which is always intrinsic. A  motive arouses one to do something.
			- Extrinsic Motivation
				- An external stimulus to  action. This type of motivation is based on incentive. This type of  motivation comes from the outside of  the individual, that is, from the  external environment.
		- Importance
			- Directs activities towards the  achievement of a goal.
			- Controls and directs human  behavior.
			- Inculcates spiritual and  moral values in the minds of  the young.
			- Gives satisfaction and  happiness to the individual.
		- Processes
			- Need --Motive/Drive--> Actions -> satisfaction
	- Incentive
		- An external benefit or reward of  some kind derived from an activity.
		- May come in the form of social  approval as praise, good grades,  honors, scholarships, medals, and 
		  the like.
	- Maslow's Hierarchy
		- Physiological
			- These refer to basic physical needs, such as drinking when thirsty or eating when hungry. According to Maslow, some of these needs involve our efforts to meet the body’s need for homeostasis; that is, maintaining consistent levels in different bodily systems. For example, food.
		- Safety
			- Once people’s physiological requirements are met, the next need that arises is a safe environment. Our safety needs are apparent even early in childhood, as children have a need for safe and predictable environments and typically react with fear or anxiety when these needs are not met. For example, shelter.
		- Love and Belonging
			- According to Maslow, the next need in the hierarchy involves feeling loved and accepted. This need includes both romantic relationships as well as ties to friends and family members. It also includes our need to feel that we belong to a social group. For example, relationships.
		- Esteem
			- Our esteem needs involve the desire to feel good about ourselves. According to Maslow, esteem needs include two components. The first involves feeling self-confidence and feeling good about oneself. When people’s esteem needs are met, they feel confident and see their contributions and achievements as valuable and important.
		- Self-Actualization
			- Self-actualization refers to feeling fulfilled, or feeling that we are living up to our potential. One unique feature of self-actualization is that it looks different for everyone. For one person, self-actualization might involve helping others.
	- Biological Motives
		- Oxygen
		- Hunger
		- Thirst
		- Sex
		- Avoidance of Pain
		- Temperature regulation
		- Bladder tension
		- Fatigue
	- Social Motives
		- Refers to an individual's desire for significant accomplishment, mastering of skills, control, or high standards.
- # Part 4 - Compliance and Obedience
  collapsed:: true
	- Compliance
		- Compliance is the act or process of complying to another person’s desire, demand or proposal.
		- Techniques used to gain compliance
			- The `Door-in-the-Face` Technique: In this approach, marketers start by asking for a large commitment. When the other person refuses, they then make a smaller and more reasonable request.
			- The `Foot-in-the-Door` Technique: In this approach, marketers start by asking for and obtaining a small commitment. Once you have already complied with the first request, you are more likely to also comply with a second, larger request
		- Example
			- when an individual performed a task when asked to, this individual is complying with a request. The unwritten law of the group and members is to stick to the rules in order to be considered as being part of the group, this is considered the most important characteristic of compliance.
	- Obedience
		- Obedience, in human behavior, is a form of social influence in which a person yields to explicit instructions or orders from an authority figure“.
		- People don’t want to be rude or offend the authority.
		- Example:
			- In schools, many teachers find that their absence from the classroom instantly causes a eruption of noise – caused by the pupils. This is because from a young age we have been brought up viewing teachers as a legitimate authority figure – and in the majority of cases we will obey them. However when the physical absence of the teacher is apparent the ‘unspoken’ rules (for example, no talking) are dismissed.
		- Importance
			- In everyday situations, people obey orders because they want to get rewards, because they want to avoid the negative consequences of  at disobeying, and because they believe an authority is legitimate. In more extreme situations, people obey even when they are required to violate their own values or commit crimes. i.e obedience of God, Parents , Teachers , etc.
	- Conformity
		- Conformity is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. It is informally defined as the tendency to act or think like members of a group.
		- In psychology, conformity is defined as the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms
		- Importance
			- A compliance program is a formal system to help in maintaining compliance in all areas of operation. The program will  at focus on upholding policies and procedures that prevent others to breaking laws and regulations. i.e compliance in banks, corporate jobs, etc.
	- Differences
		- Obedience involves an order; conformity involves a
		  request.
		- Obedience involves following the order of someone
		  with a higher status; conformity usually involves
		  going along with people of equal status.
		- Obedience relies on social power; conformity relies
		  on the need to be socially accepted.
	- The Migram Experiment
		- Milgram (1963) was interested in researching how far people would go in obeying an instruction if it involved harming another person.
		- Stanley Milgram was interested in how easily ordinary people could be influenced into committing atrocities, for example, Germans in WWII.
		- Results
			- 65% (two-thirds) of participants (i.e., teachers) continued to the highest level of 450 volts. All the participants continued to 300 volts.
			- Milgram did more than one experiment – he carried out 18 variations of his study. All he did was alter the situation (IV) to see how this affected obedience (DV).
		- Conclusion
			- Ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being. Obedience to authority is ingrained in us all from the way we are brought up. People tend to obey orders from other people if they recognize their authority as morally right and/or legally based. This response to legitimate authority is learned in a variety of situations, for example in the family, school, and workplace.

		- `Storming`: Once the forming stage is over, the individuals will start interacting with each other in the context of the task to be achieved.
		- `Norming`: Here, everybody works cohesively towards the target and appreciate each other’s experience and skills.
		- `Performing`: At this stage, synergy gets created between the team members, where everyone works towards the accomplishment of a goal. This stage is characterized by flexibility and interdependence. 
		  `Adjourning`: This is the last stage of group development, where the group is terminated, and the group members are separated from each other. Every group is created for a purpose, and once the purpose is fulfilled the group is adjourned.

			- Traits are enduring attributes associated with an individual's personality or makeup
		- Behavioral Theory
			- Behavioral leadership theories (derived from Ohio State and University Of Michigan Studies) focus on common behaviors common to effective leaders
			- The Ohio State leadership studies identified two important leader behaviors
				- Initiating Structure (defining, organizing, structuring the work situation)
				- Consideration (showing concern for feelings and needs of followers)
			- University Of Michigan Studies also identifies two important leadership behaviors
				- Relationship Oriented Behaviors (Leader Behavior focused on interpersonal relationship on the job)
				- Task Oriented Behaviors (Leader Behaviors focused on work task)
		- Contingencies Theory
			- Fiedler's contingency model maintains that effective leadership depends on match between the leader's style and the degree to which the work situation gives control and influence to the leader
			- According to Fiedler ,leader may be primarily task oriented or relationship oriented
			- In Fiedler's model ,to assess the work situation ,three situation are examined
				- Leader-member relations (relationship between leader and followers)
				- Task Structure (how well elements of the work task are structured)

	- Lewin's leadership styles
		- Autocratic
			- In the autocratic style, the leader takes decisions without consulting with others.
		- Democratic
			- In the democratic style, the leader involves the people in the decision-making, although the process for the final decision may vary from the leader having the final say to them facilitating consensus in the group.
	- Types of Leadership
		- Authoritarian Leadership(autocratic leaders)
			- The autocrat gives orders and expects prompt execution, with little-to-no feedback or input from the worker. This leadership style can work in a production-type environment that demands maximal output in simple, repetitive job roles. It rarely allows for an environment in which creativity will flourish. The autocrat pushes employees hard; often, he does not get loyalty and long-term commitments in return. High turnover and low satisfaction is expected, in response to this leadership style. There are times when autocratic leadership is effective
		- Participative Leadership (Democratic)
			- this is generally the most effective leadership style. Democratic leaders offer guidance to group members, but they also participate in the group and allow input from other group members.
		- Delegative (Laissez-Faire) Leadership
			- Researchers found that children under delegative leadership were the least productive . The children in this group also made more demands on the leader, showed little cooperation and were unable to work independently. Delegative leaders offer little or no guidance to group members and leave decision-making up to group members. While this style can be effective in situations where group members are highly qualified in an area of expertise, it often leads to poorly defined roles and a lack of motivation.
		- Transactional Leadership
			- Transactional leadership relies more about "trades" between the leader and follower by which followers are compensated for meeting specific goals or performance criteria . The transactional leader will first validate the relationship between performance and reward and then exchange it for an appropriate response that encourages subordinates to improve performance . Transactional leadership in organizations plays an exchange role between managers and subordinates. Transactional leadership style is understood to be the exchange of rewards and targets between employees and management .
		- Transformational Leadership
			- leadership approach that causes change in individuals and social systems. In its ideal form, it creates valuable and positive change in the followers with the end goal of developing followers into leaders.
			- There are four main components of transformational leadership:
				- 1. Individualized consideration
				- 2. Intellectual stimulation
				- 3. Inspirational Motivation
				- 4. Idealized Influence.
			- Each of these components are positively related to individual and organizational performance.

- # Part 9 - Personality
  collapsed:: true
	- Personality has been derived from the Latin word `persona` which means `mask` used by the actors to change their appearance. It is the combination of an individual thoughts, characteristics, behaviors, attitude, idea and habits.
	- As a professional term in psychology, personality is a person's unique patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior. This means that personality is all the characteristics of who we are as unique individuals.
	- When psychologists study personality, they usually conduct two different kinds of research.
		- How and why people differ in a particular characteristic or group of characteristics like humor, being outgoing, aggression, and more.
		- How the different traits in a person's personality work together to create who they are and how they interact with the world around them.
	- The `ideographic view` of personality sees each person as completely unique individuals. People cannot be compared with one another because their psychological makeups are integrated wholes and not a series of comparable characteristics.
	- This contrasts the `nomothetic view` that states that personality traits can be compared between people and where each person places on a scale of that trait. Their unique personality is thus observed by mapping their position along these traits.
	- Types
		- Extrovert
			- This type has the tendency to live mostly outside the like to live with others. Those individuals are highly socialized and have contact with outside people in the society. They want to join other groups who are more in number.
		- Introvert
			- Introvert is opposite to extrovert. Those people are always live alone in their rooms and do not want to go outside. They have their own imaginary world. They are teachers, scientists, thinkers and philosophers.
		- Ambivert
			- Between extrovert and introvert personalities there is a third one type called ambivert. People belonging to this type enjoy both the groups and attend them. They have middle mind and want to live in both parties.  Sometimes they join outside people but sometimes they live in their own rooms.

		- Conscientiousness
			- People who are conscientious are organized and have a strong sense of duty. They're dependable, disciplined and achievement-focused. You won't find conscientious types jetting off on round-the-world journeys with only a backpack; they're planners.
		- Extraversion
			- Extraversion versus introversion is possibly the most recognizable personality trait of the Big Five. The more of an extravert someone is, the more of a social butterfly they are. Extraverts are chatty, sociable and draw energy from crowds. They tend to be assertive and cheerful in their social interactions.
		- Agreeableness
			- Agreeableness measures the extent of a person's warmth and kindness. The more agreeable someone is, the more likely they are to be trusting, helpful and compassionate. Disagreeable people are cold and suspicious of others, and they're less likely to cooperate.

	- Can Personality Change ?
		- Maybe. A study published in the January 2017 published research papers and found that personality may be altered through therapy. "For the people who want to change their spouse tomorrow, which a lot of people want to do, I don't hold out much hope for them," said study researcher Brent Roberts, a social and personality psychologist at the University of Illinois. However, he continued, "if you're willing to focus on one aspect of yourself, and you're willing to go at it systematically, there's now increased optimism that you can affect change in that domain."
