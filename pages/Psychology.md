  collapsed:: true
	- Classical Conditioning `Ivan Pavlov`
		- The typical procedure for inducing classical conditioning involves presentations of a neutral stimulus along with a stimulus of some significance.
		- The neutral stimulus could be any event that does not result in an overt behavioral response from the organism under investigation. Pavlov referred to this as a Conditioned Stimulus (CS).
	- Operant conditioning `B F Skinner`
		- Operant conditioning can be defined as a type of learning in which voluntary (controllable; non-reflexive) behavior is strengthened if it is reinforced and weakened if it is punished (or not reinforced).
	- Psychodynamic approach `Sigmund Freud`
		- The approach based on the belief that behavior is motivated by unconscious inner forces over which the individual has little control.
		- Key features of the Psychodynamic approach are:
			- Our behavior and feelings as adults are rooted in our childhood experiences.
			  Relationships (particularly parenting) are of primary importance in determining how we feel and behave.
			- Our behavior and feelings are powerfully affected by the meaning of events to the unconscious mind.  Information can be obtained from dreams, irrational behavior and what patients in therapy say.
			- The personality is made up of three distinct structures: id, ego and super ego.
			  Defense mechanisms are used to protect the ego, e.g. repression.

	- Maslow's Hierarchy
		- Physiological
			- These refer to basic physical needs, such as drinking when thirsty or eating when hungry. According to Maslow, some of these needs involve our efforts to meet the body’s need for homeostasis; that is, maintaining consistent levels in different bodily systems. For example, food.
		- Safety
			- Once people’s physiological requirements are met, the next need that arises is a safe environment. Our safety needs are apparent even early in childhood, as children have a need for safe and predictable environments and typically react with fear or anxiety when these needs are not met. For example, shelter.
		- Love and Belonging
			- According to Maslow, the next need in the hierarchy involves feeling loved and accepted. This need includes both romantic relationships as well as ties to friends and family members. It also includes our need to feel that we belong to a social group. For example, relationships.
		- Esteem
			- Our esteem needs involve the desire to feel good about ourselves. According to Maslow, esteem needs include two components. The first involves feeling self-confidence and feeling good about oneself. When people’s esteem needs are met, they feel confident and see their contributions and achievements as valuable and important.
		- Self-Actualization
			- Self-actualization refers to feeling fulfilled, or feeling that we are living up to our potential. One unique feature of self-actualization is that it looks different for everyone. For one person, self-actualization might involve helping others.
	- Biological Motives

- # Part 4 - Compliance and Obedience
  collapsed:: true
	- Compliance
		- Compliance is the act or process of complying to another person’s desire, demand or proposal.
		- Techniques used to gain compliance
			- The `Door-in-the-Face` Technique: In this approach, marketers start by asking for a large commitment. When the other person refuses, they then make a smaller and more reasonable request.
			- The `Foot-in-the-Door` Technique: In this approach, marketers start by asking for and obtaining a small commitment. Once you have already complied with the first request, you are more likely to also comply with a second, larger request
		- Example
			- when an individual performed a task when asked to, this individual is complying with a request. The unwritten law of the group and members is to stick to the rules in order to be considered as being part of the group, this is considered the most important characteristic of compliance.
	- Obedience
		- Obedience, in human behavior, is a form of social influence in which a person yields to explicit instructions or orders from an authority figure“.
		- People don’t want to be rude or offend the authority.
		- Example:
			- In schools, many teachers find that their absence from the classroom instantly causes a eruption of noise – caused by the pupils. This is because from a young age we have been brought up viewing teachers as a legitimate authority figure – and in the majority of cases we will obey them. However when the physical absence of the teacher is apparent the ‘unspoken’ rules (for example, no talking) are dismissed.
		- Importance
			- In everyday situations, people obey orders because they want to get rewards, because they want to avoid the negative consequences of  at disobeying, and because they believe an authority is legitimate. In more extreme situations, people obey even when they are required to violate their own values or commit crimes. i.e obedience of God, Parents , Teachers , etc.
	- Conformity
		- Conformity is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. It is informally defined as the tendency to act or think like members of a group.
		- In psychology, conformity is defined as the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms
		- Importance
			- A compliance program is a formal system to help in maintaining compliance in all areas of operation. The program will  at focus on upholding policies and procedures that prevent others to breaking laws and regulations. i.e compliance in banks, corporate jobs, etc.
	- Differences
		- Obedience involves an order; conformity involves a
		  request.
		- Obedience involves following the order of someone
		  with a higher status; conformity usually involves
		  going along with people of equal status.
		- Obedience relies on social power; conformity relies
		  on the need to be socially accepted.
	- The Migram Experiment
		- Milgram (1963) was interested in researching how far people would go in obeying an instruction if it involved harming another person.
		- Stanley Milgram was interested in how easily ordinary people could be influenced into committing atrocities, for example, Germans in WWII.
		- Results
			- 65% (two-thirds) of participants (i.e., teachers) continued to the highest level of 450 volts. All the participants continued to 300 volts.
			- Milgram did more than one experiment – he carried out 18 variations of his study. All he did was alter the situation (IV) to see how this affected obedience (DV).
		- Conclusion
			- Ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being. Obedience to authority is ingrained in us all from the way we are brought up. People tend to obey orders from other people if they recognize their authority as morally right and/or legally based. This response to legitimate authority is learned in a variety of situations, for example in the family, school, and workplace.

	- Types of Leadership
		- Authoritarian Leadership(autocratic leaders)
			- The autocrat gives orders and expects prompt execution, with little-to-no feedback or input from the worker. This leadership style can work in a production-type environment that demands maximal output in simple, repetitive job roles. It rarely allows for an environment in which creativity will flourish. The autocrat pushes employees hard; often, he does not get loyalty and long-term commitments in return. High turnover and low satisfaction is expected, in response to this leadership style. There are times when autocratic leadership is effective

			- Researchers found that children under delegative leadership were the least productive . The children in this group also made more demands on the leader, showed little cooperation and were unable to work independently. Delegative leaders offer little or no guidance to group members and leave decision-making up to group members. While this style can be effective in situations where group members are highly qualified in an area of expertise, it often leads to poorly defined roles and a lack of motivation.
		- Transactional Leadership
			- Transactional leadership relies more about "trades" between the leader and follower by which followers are compensated for meeting specific goals or performance criteria . The transactional leader will first validate the relationship between performance and reward and then exchange it for an appropriate response that encourages subordinates to improve performance . Transactional leadership in organizations plays an exchange role between managers and subordinates. Transactional leadership style is understood to be the exchange of rewards and targets between employees and management .

			- There are four main components of transformational leadership:
				- 1. Individualized consideration
				- 2. Intellectual stimulation
				- 3. Inspirational Motivation
				- 4. Idealized Influence.
